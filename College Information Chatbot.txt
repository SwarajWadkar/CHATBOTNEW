Project Title: College Information ChatBot (Java + Swing)

Overview:
This is a desktop-based chatbot application built using Java Swing. It is designed to provide automated responses to common queries related to the MCA (Master of Computer Applications) program of a college. The chatbot mimics a text-based conversation and gives predefined responses based on keywords entered by the user.


Features:

Simple graphical user interface using Java Swing
Chat window with user input and bot responses
Responds to over 25 predefined college-related questions
Displays the current date on request
Provides Google search fallback for unknown questions
Clears the chat screen on user command
Help command shows list of supported queries
Neon green on black theme for terminal-like appearance
Responsive "Send" button with hover effect


Technologies Used:
Java
Java Swing (JFrame, JTextArea, JTextField, JButton, JScrollPane)
java.time.LocalDate for date management
java.util.Random for random greetings and responses
java.net.URI and Desktop class for fallback web search


How it works:
The user enters a query in the input field and clicks "Send" or presses Enter.
The chatbot checks the message for specific keywords.
If a keyword matches a predefined topic (e.g., fees, placements, timings), the bot responds with a stored answer.
If the query doesn't match any known topic, the bot opens the default browser and performs a Google search using the userâ€™s input.
The user can type 'help' to get a list of supported topics.
Typing 'clear' will reset the chat area.


Example questions the chatbot can answer:
What are the fees for the MCA course?
What is the timing for MCA?
What is the duration of the MCA program?
How are the placements for MCA?
Which companies come for placement?
What is the highest package offered?
Does the college provide internships?
What workshops are conducted?
